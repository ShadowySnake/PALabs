Created the new folder for LAB4 at PA.

UPDATE 1 ::: 
---- Created the compulsory package. Added in MAIN methods to initialize two Classes ( Students and Schools ) using streams.
---- Practically, for Students I initialise A LINKEDLIST with new students (S0, S1, S2, S3) and for Schools I initialise A TreeSet with new schools (H0, H1, H2).
---- Have not Added the preferences list for Students and Scools.

UPDATE 2 ::: 
---- Forgot to push the changes last time (worked on the update above on Monday), pushed them now.

UPDATE 3 :::
---- Restructured, made a class that occupies itself with the initializers instead of just using MAIN.

UPDATE 4 :::
---- Added the capacity for each school.
---- Added the initialization of preferences list for Students and Schools using lists.
